### Dislaimer
This project is a side project, and a product of a half weekend, if people will find joy in it, we will put more effort into it.
Both of us creating it, used a personally new framework. It was fun.

Every day you get the value propositions of 5 CNCF projects and you have to guess what the projects are! You have three attempts per project, and can get two hints should you need it.

Depending how many hints you use:
- 🟢 You got the project right without any hints.
- 🟡 You got the project right using 1 hint.
- 🟠 You got the project right using 2 hints.
- 🔴 You didn't get the project right.
- ⚪ Unanswered questions.


Your data is stored client-side (browser local storage). More details [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). The quiz is reset every noon (UTC).
